# Collateralized Loan Smart Contract Hardhat Project

This project demonstrates a smart contract that will:

- Allow users to deposit ETH as collateral and request a loan.
- Enable other users to fund those loans and earn interest.
- Provide functionality for borrowers to repay loans with interest.
- Permit lenders to claim collateral if the borrower defaults.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
npx hardhat help
npx hardhat test
REPORT_GAS=true npx hardhat test
npx hardhat node
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js
```
